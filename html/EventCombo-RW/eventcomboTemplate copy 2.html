                  Empowering Women in Tech: An Inspiring Panel Discussion
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Join us for an empowering event where three distinguished women share their journeys to success in the tech industry, a field traditionally dominated by men. Their stories are not about luck but about hard work, perseverance, and the power of self-promotion. As Liz Rogers puts it, "I learned very early on that if I did not promote myself - no one else was going to."</p>
