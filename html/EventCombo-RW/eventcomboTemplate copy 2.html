            Machine learning can save time and money by automating repetitive tasks, identifying patterns in large datasets more efficiently than manual methods, and enabling predictive analytics that optimizes processes and decision-making.</p>

          <p>
           Join us to discover real-life examples of how machine learning is shaping the textile industry. Explore how machine learning assists designers and fashion brands throughout various fashion design and development processes, facilitating the creation and evaluation of styles.</p>
           
           <p>By handling repetitive design tasks, machine learning empowers designers to focus on unleashing their creativity on a broader scale. These technologies aim to collaborate with (not replace!) human fashion experts. 
          </p>
          <h4>Key Takeaways:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>- Learn how machine learning can replicate the drape and flow of fabrics on virtual models, allowing faster design testing.</li>
              <li>- Hear how systems can automatically generate technical drawings from images, freeing up designers and speeding up production time.</li>
              <li>- See how basic sketches can be transformed into 3D models for interactive visualization and editing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><b>Meet the presenter:</b> Rosemary Nwosu-Ihueze is the CEO and founder of Kemdi Attire</h4>
             Rosemary has an associate degree in computer programming from Jefferson Community and Technical College, currently a business major at the University of Louisville.</p>
           <p>Past work experiences include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>- Machine Learning Research Intern at the University of Louisville
                Software intern at Cadence Design System</li>
              <li>- Rosemary started Kemdi Attire to solve a problem - sizing.  Rosemary always had sizing issues whenever she bought clothes online. Nothing ever fits perfectly.  Rosemary has found a way to solve this problem with machine learning.</li>
