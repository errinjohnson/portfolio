          Join us in exploring the dynamic landscape of mobile development as we delve into two key trends that are shaping the future of this ever-evolving field: collaboration and personalization.</p>

          <p>
          First, we'll explore the potential of declarative frameworks, including Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI, and tools for seamless code sharing across platforms and how, with these tools, teams are empowered to move faster and collaborate better by introducing shared patterns and shared logic across Android, iOS, and web platforms. 
          </p>

            Then, we'll delve into the transformative impact of AI and ML on the mobile experience. We’ll talk about personalized use cases and the role of tools like ChatGPT. We’ll look at the growing ecosystem of devices and the broader spectrum of problems we can solve on the most suitable devices, contributing to a more comprehensive and adaptive mobile platform.
