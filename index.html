                        databases. I am naturally investigative, I started out taking apart computers to see how they
                        work and watching DIY programs to learn what I needed at that time, such as replacing a screen
                        on a tablet, or iPhone.

                        another database for the same company, trained their employees, users of the databases, and
                        communicated with their IT department to add the database to a company’s network, to maintain
                        and to update. My best success was when there was a collaboration with my peers. I believe in
                        good communication, simple considerations, the ability to allow someone’s idea to succeed, and
                        cooperation.

                                of the assignment, or the software they were using for the assignment, I created a CIT
                                lab outside of normal KCTC class hours. The lab was at the same campus location. I
                                received permission from my supervisor for my request to hold the lab for students. This
                                aspect of the lab was on my own time.

                            work on the collection accounts. After working for them for 3 months, the company saw my
                            technical skills, and hired me for contractual work, to set up the new ESC software systems.
                            I took initiative for the project when I realized I understood the foundation of data
                            conversion and systems, and I knew I could contact ESC staff for support to help me walk
                            thru some of the setups. I understood technical jargon and I asked to set up the system.
